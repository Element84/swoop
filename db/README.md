# `swoop-db`

The swoop database schema is managed via `dbmate`. `dbmate` will apply all
migration files found in the `./migrations` directory. We wrap the [upstream
dbmate tool](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate) with a bash script
(`./dbmate`) to enforce a custom workflow where `./schema.sql` is not a "schema
only" dump after applying migrations, but is instead a manually-edited
reference schema.

The `dbmate` help is overridden by the wrapper script and includes details
about what is overridden and how. The main things of note:

* `./schema.sql` is not automatically dumped by `dbmate` commands
* `create` has an option to load a schema into the database
* `verify` is a new command that will check differences between `./schema.sql`
  and the schema generated by applying all of the migration files
* `test` is a new command (specific to swoop) to run the database tests

The `dbmate` wrapper can be run from the local OS against the postgres docker
container, but is typically easier to run within the container itself. See
details below.

## Extensions

`swoop-db` makes use of two postgres extensions:

* `pg_partman`: an automated table partition manager
* `pgtap`: a postgres-native testing framework

## Database testing with docker

`./Dockerfile` defines the build steps for a database test container. The
container includes the requsite postgres extensions and any other required
utilities like `dbmate` and `pg_prove`. The root swoop-api `docker-compose.yml`
can be used to bring up the container with the necessary configuration, after
sourcing the root `.env` file to get the environment configuation.

The repo contents are mounted as `/swoop` inside the container to help
facilitate database operations and testing using the included utilities. For
example, to bring up the database and run the tests:

```shell
# bring up the database container in the background
docker compose up -d

# create the database and apply all migrations
docker compose exec postgres dbmate up

# run the database tests
docker compose exec postgres dbmate test db/tests/

# connect to the database with psql
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres swoop
```

To verify the schema and migrations match:

```shell
# drop an existing database to start clean
docker compose exec postgres dbmate drop

# run the verification; any diff indicates schema/migrations out-of-sync
docker compose exec postgres dbmate verify
```

### Adding a migration

Use `dbmate` if needing to create a new migration file:

```shell
docker compose exec postgres dbmate new <migration_name>
```

### Adding database tests

Database tests should be added as `.sql` files in the `./tests` directory.
Follow the pattern of the existing test files. It's best to keep each file
short and focused with a descriptive name. For more about the `pgtap` test
framework see [the documentation](https://pgtap.org/documentation.html).

## pre-commit hooks related to the database

We use `sqlfluff` for linting sql. See the root `.sqlfluff` config file and the
command defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for more information. Note
that the tool is a bit slow and somewhat inaccurate at times; it is better than
nothing but we should not hesitate to replace it with a better option if one
becomes available.
